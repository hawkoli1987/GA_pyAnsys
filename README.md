# GA_pyAnsys
Genetic Algorithm implemented in pyAnsys for optimizing gecko setae biomimetic design

GA_20_convergence is a test code with 20 (# of generations) x 20(population size) Genetic Algorithm implementation. The primary objective is to test the code implementation and run convergency study.

GA_100_final is the final code running at larger population size and # of generations.

Pre-requisite for running pyAnsys:
1. install Ansys student version
2. install Anaconda
3. create virtual environment
4. Activate the virtual environment just created
5. Install the following into the virtual environment:
    a.  ipykernel
    b.  jupyter notebook
    c.	pyMADPL
6.	Run jupyter notebook with starting directory of the file location where the code file is stored: jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=YOUR_DIRECTORY
